summary: During the summer of 2015, my father tasked me to create a logo for "Aurora Model Management", and help build up the website.

Aurora is an event management industry that showcases Australia's models, and as well as host events. My father, whom was a web designer and developer, wanted to give me a "job", so I can gain some experience and utilize some of the skills that I have attained. Afterwards, he showed me how he was able to utilize JavaScript to incorporate fun and interactive parts to the site. 

To begin this project, I first started off with creating the logo. I began sketching out numerous variations that can represent their model management. With this process I had to look at different fonts and color palettes that can suit the logo and the site. I used Adobe Illustrator to create a clean file to show all different choices for the logo. After finishing up the logo, I began looking at different websites to gain inspiration on how I want to go about making the website. From there I drawed it out on paper, and began constructing the basic look of it in HTML, then I began stylizing the site with CSS. I then sent over my work to my dad and from there, my dad changed a few things here and there, and implemented JavaScript to the website.
