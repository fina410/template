Computers and technology have always been a fascination to me, ever since I was young. When I was about 10 years old, I began learning HTML, and then later CSS. From these experiences I had I realized that this was something that I enjoyed doing. With the support and encouragement from my parents, I decided to push for a degree in Computer Science.

## Interests in Software Engineering

I am interested in more of the design and development side of software engineering. I like the idea being able to create something eye-catching and something that everyone can use easily. The ability to utilize creativity to make a new range of capabilities. Whats neat about this field is that you come up with innovative ways of developing solutions to problems.

## Future Skills and Experiences

As an immediate goal of this semester, I hope to be able to be fully comfortable and understand JavaScript. With this I can apply it to producing dynamic webpages, and develop web applications.  Later on, I hope to learn more programming languages to increase my diversity and comprehension of being able to solve problems in numerous ways. I hope that I can utilize the skills that I attain to further my knowledge and gain opportunity.
