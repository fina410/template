Communication is life skill that all of us utilize throughout the day. One of the major parts of communication is being able to formulate your own  questions. The well-known saying, “There are no wrong/bad questions”, turns out to be wrong. An individual who asks questions in class is someone who is engaged, and have a want to learn. However, being able to develop formulate a good question takes practice.

## Interests in Software Engineering

I am interested in more of the design and development side of software engineering. I like the idea being able to create something eye-catching and something that everyone can use easily. The ability to utilize creativity to make a new range of capabilities. Whats neat about this field is that you come up with innovative ways of developing solutions to problems.

## Future Skills and Experiences

As an immediate goal of this semester, I hope to be able to be fully comfortable and understand JavaScript. With this I can apply it to producing dynamic webpages, and develop web applications.  Later on, I hope to learn more programming languages to increase my diversity and comprehension of being able to solve problems in numerous ways. I hope that I can utilize the skills that I attain to further my knowledge and gain opportunity.
